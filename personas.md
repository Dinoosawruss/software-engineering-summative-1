2. To be able to modify and save reusable Markdown content to share it with his team.

# High-Level User Stories

From personas and empathy maps, I generated 5 high-level user stories:
1. As a user, I want to view live previews of my Markdown content so that I can immediately see how it will render any rectify any issues.
2. As a user, I want the option to customise the view of the editor, such as, switching between light and dark mode so that the website is accessible.
3. As a user, I want the editor to be lightweight and intuitive, so that I can focus on editing Markdown rather than learning the tool I am using.
4. As a user, I want to create and edit Markdown with syntax highlighting, so that code in the Markdown can be read easily.
5. As a user, I want the tool to be accessible via the web, so that I can avoid downloading more software to my machine.
